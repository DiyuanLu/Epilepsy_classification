Files with F and N contain focal and non-focal signal pairs, respectively. Each Zip-file contains 750 individual text files. The number in the file name corresponds to the index of the signal pair contained in this file. Each text file contains one individual signal pair. The x-signal is contained in the first column, the y-signal is contained in the second column. The two columns are separated by commas. All files have 10240 rows. Subsequent rows correspond to subsequent samples. The files contain no headers.

We also provide a small subset of the recordings containing the first 50 signals only (Data_F_50.zip and Data_N_50.zip). This will allow you to have a quick look at the data before deciding whether you want to download the entire dataset.

sampling_rate = original from 1024 Hz downsampled to 512 Hz
